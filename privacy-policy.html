<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Live Scale Detector</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”)
handles information when you use our mobile application published on the Google Play Store.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
<strong>Live Scale Detector does not collect, store, or require any personally identifiable information.</strong>
</p>

<p>The app requires access to the following device feature:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Microphone</strong> – Used only for real-time audio input to detect musical notes and scales.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All audio processing happens <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
Audio is not recorded, stored, or transmitted.
</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Microphone permission is required strictly for the core functionality of live scale detection.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The app does <strong>not</strong> use the camera or access any visual data.
</p>

<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>
Live Scale Detector uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads.
</p>

<p>
AdMob may collect certain information automatically, including but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device information (such as device type, OS version)</li>

    <li>Approximate location (non-precise)</li>
    <li>Ad interaction data</li>
